## Project Description 

Create a ROS package with custom launch files to localize the robot in an environment given the map and also to autonomous navigation. 

*Use the given [map](map/map2d.yaml) for the myoffice world [here](../betabot_gazebo/worlds/myoffice.world)*

</p>


>NOTE: For the given map and a world the betabot robot should localize it self and move from currant pose to a given goal autonomously

## Part II: Localization (amcl)

### In your own words how amcl works?

It's a probabilistic approach to localize the robot. Similar to how EKF works, it is possible to obtain a probability distribution of the robot position based on multiple inputs. However, amcl uses a particle filter which samples a distribution, allowing for much more flexible modeling that's not only restricted to Gaussian distributions. It works by sampling the distribution, assigning weights to accurate particles, then resampling. It's also adaptive in the sense that the number of particles in use could be varied depending on resources.  

### Is there other better approaches to localize your robot rather than amcl?

EKF or unscented KF. They could offer better performance in some cases, however, they are restricted to Gaussian distributions.

### What are the amcl limitations or the fail cases?

It is computationally demanding, so in many cases it could fail due to the restrictions on the number of particles which can dramatically affect the performance, if the processing facility is limited. Also it can diverge in some cases.

### Is amcl used in domain rather than Robotics?

It's possible to use it to obtain a simulated probability distribution that characterizes a given variable.

## Part III: Navigation (move_base)

### How many official local planner available in ROS?

Depending on the cost function, the base_local_planner could offer 3 different planning approaches. 

### which local planner did you use?

TrajectoryPlannerROS.

### In your own words how the local planner you selected works?

Given a local map that's generated by a range sensor, it generates a number of paths, which are then checked and searched. After ruling out the paths that will surely collide with an object based on the map, it assigns each possible path a score based on its characteristics in terms of length or other features. The path scoring the highest is then considered and followed. 

### How many official global planner available in ROS?

5

### which global planner did you use?

Navfn

### In your own words how the global planner you selected works?

Given a global map of the environment and the robot current location on it, the global planner executes a shortest path algorithm e.g. Dijkstra or A* to find the shortest path between the robot current pos and the desired end point. Since the map is devided into pixels (squares), the planner considers each square a step and then computes the path that goes towards the goal or scans the map entirely towards the goal to find the shortest path in case of Dijkstra.

### State your suggestion increase the overall performance?

Tuning the speed of the robot, common map parameters, number of particles in amcl, align the map well. 

### List the most time consuming problems you faced

Tuning the parameters in the configuration files.
